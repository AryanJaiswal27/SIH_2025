Problem Description

Many educational institutions still depend on manual attendance systems, which are time-consuming and error-prone. Teachers spend a significant portion of class time marking attendance, reducing valuable instructional hours. Additionally, students often waste free periods with unproductive activities due to a lack of structured guidance. This leads to poor time management and reduced alignment with long-term academic or career goals. There is also a gap in personalized learning support during idle classroom hours. Institutions currently lack tools that integrate daily schedules with individual student planning and automated tracking.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

This issue impacts both administrative efficiency and student development. Automating attendance saves teachers' time and ensures more accurate records. Additionally, providing students with structured personal development activities during free time helps improve productivity, goal clarity, and learning outcomes. Institutions can also gain better insight into student behavior and engagement, allowing for more targeted support.

Expected Outcomes

• Automatically marks student attendance based on the daily timetable using QR code, Bluetooth/Wi-Fi proximity, or face recognition.
• Displays real-time attendance on a classroom screen.
• Suggests personalized academic tasks during free periods based on the student's interests, strengths, and career goals.
• Generates a daily routine combining class schedule, free time, and long-term personal goals.

The app will require minimal infrastructure and be usable by both students and staff with basic training.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Students
• Teachers
• College administrators
• Career counselors
• Education departments

Supporting Data

• Surveys and reports on classroom time usage, student productivity, and NEP 2020 recommendations emphasizing personalized and experiential learning.

Problem Description

Many rural schools in India rely on manual attendance systems, which are time-consuming and prone to errors. Teachers spend significant time marking attendance, reducing instructional time. Additionally, inaccurate records can lead to discrepancies in government reporting for schemes like mid-day meals. This problem is prevalent in under-resourced schools with limited access to technology, affecting administrative efficiency and student tracking.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

This issue affects over 50% of rural schools, impacting millions of students and teachers. It leads to inefficiencies, delays in reporting, and potential mismanagement of resources. Solving this will save time, improve accuracy, and enhance resource allocation.

Expected Outcomes

• A low-cost, user-friendly software or mobile application that automates attendance using facial recognition or RFID-based systems.
• Requires minimal infrastructure and training for deployment in rural schools.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• School administrators
• Teachers
• Students
• Government education departments

Supporting Data

• Annual Status of Education Report (ASER) 2024, highlighting administrative challenges in rural schools.

Background

Higher Education institutions often face challenges in efficient class scheduling due to limited infrastructure, faculty constraints, elective courses, and overlapping departmental requirements. Manual timetable preparation leads to frequent clashes in classes, underutilized classrooms, uneven workload distribution, and dissatisfied students and faculty members. With the increasing adoption of multidisciplinary curricula and flexible learning under NEP 2020, the class scheduling process has become more complex and dynamic, requiring intelligent and adaptive solutions.

Description

The current scheduling mechanism in most higher education institutes/colleges relies on manual input via spreadsheets or basic tools. These fail to account for real-time availability of faculty, room capacity, teaching load norms, subject combinations, and student preferences. A solution is required that will accommodate the various parameters required for scheduling classes for UG and PG students and return an optimized timetable ensuring:
• Maximized utilization of classrooms and laboratories
• Minimized workload on faculty members and students
• Achievement of required learning outcomes

Key Parameters

The following parameters can be taken into account as variables for creating optimized timetables:
- Number of classrooms available
- Number of batches of students
- Number of subjects to be taught in a particular semester
- Names of subjects
- Maximum number of classes per day
- Number of classes to be conducted for a subject per week / per day
- Number of faculties available for different subjects
- Average number of leaves a faculty member takes in a month
- Special classes that have fixed slots in timetable

Students may also consider additional variables that may help in effective timetable preparation.

Expected Solution

A web-based platform that can be linked to the college website. Authorized personnel will be able to login and input data against the listed variables to generate fully optimized timetables.

The platform should include:
• Login facility for authorized personnel to create and manage timetables
• Multiple options of optimized timetables to choose from
• Review and approval workflow for competent authorities
• Suggestions for suitable rearrangements when optimal solutions are not available
• Support for multi-department and multi-shift scheduling

_______________
Problem Summary
_______________

Educational institutions face two major challenges:

Attendance Management – Manual attendance systems are time-consuming, error-prone, and reduce teaching time.

Timetable & Productivity Optimization – Manual scheduling leads to classroom clashes, uneven faculty workload, underutilization of infrastructure, and unproductive student free periods.

Impact

Wastes instructional time and reduces efficiency.

Students often misuse free time, missing opportunities for skill development and career alignment.

Administrators struggle with faculty allocation, classroom utilization, and adapting to NEP 2020’s flexible, multidisciplinary curriculum.

Expected Outcomes

Automated Attendance using face recognition, QR, or RFID with real-time display and accurate tracking.

Personalized Student Guidance that suggests academic tasks or career-oriented activities during free periods.

Optimized Timetable Generator that considers faculty load, student preferences, classroom capacity, subject combinations, and special slots, while minimizing clashes and maximizing resource utilization.

Web-based Platform for authorized staff to generate, review, and approve multiple timetable options with smart suggestions.

Beneficiaries

Students, Teachers, College Administrators, Career Counselors, Education Departments.
